# Ipums_twins_study
I wrote this code for a Microeconomics paper completed as part of my Masters course work. This project involved reading Angrist and Evans' 1997 Paper 'Children and Their Parents' Labour Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size'. Using this paper, I identified the methadology, assumptions, and dataset used by the authors. From here, I used IPUMS CENSUS data and attempted to replicate the code written by the authors to duplicate their findings. 

For this assignment, I recieved an A.

In this repository, you will find my code, the annotated paper, and a reference list where I document the link between Angrist and Evans' described methadology/data and the code I wrote.
